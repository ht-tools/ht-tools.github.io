        Draining and refilling your hot tub is generally needed every 3-6 months, depending on usage. Here are the steps to drain and refill your hot tub:
      </p>
      
      <h2>Draining your Hot Tub</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Remove filters and place filter guard (and anything else that should be cleaned) in bottom of the tub.</li>
        <li>Add Ahh-Some or your preferred jet cleaner to hot tub and follow directions on cleaner.</li>
        <li>Shut off power to the hot tub at the breaker.</li>
        <li>Use a pump or built-in drain valve to drain all hot tub water.</li>
        <li>Use Off-the-Wall or similar cleaner to scrub inner hot tub surfaces, including inside of cover.</li>
        <li>Rinse hot tub and remove residual water and debris with wet vac.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Filling your Hot Tub</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Fill with garden hose to top of highest jet or manufacturer's fill line (insert hose in each filter inlet to start, to avoid airlock).</li>
        <li>While the tub is filling, spray the top of cover and outside of tub with 303 Protectant or similar.</li>
        <li>Once the tub is at the fill line, turn on breaker and check for airlock (follow manufacturer's instructions to break airlock if needed).</li>
        <li>Insert clean or new filters and filter guard.</li>
        <li>Test water with Taylor K-2005 or K-2006 kit. Enter results on Maintain tab and set Target amounts to determine chemical amounts needed.</li>
        <li>Adjust Total Alkalinity (TA) to 50 ppm using Sodium Bicarbonate (Up) or Sodium Bisulfate (Down).</li>
        <li>Adjust pH to 7.6 using Sodium Carbonate (Up) or Sodium Bisulfate (Down) - WAIT 2 HOURS AFTER TA ADJUSTMENT IF OPPOSITE UP/DOWN IS NEEDED.</li>
        <li>Add 50 ppm of Boric Acid to create buffer solution (helps lock in pH level) - use Setup tab to determine amount.</li>
        <li>Add Calcium Chloride to achieve Calcium Hardness (CH) of 150.</li>
        <li>Using Dichlor, schock to 50 ppm Free Chlorine (FC) to decontaminate (this will also put cyanuric acid (CYA) at ~40 ppm which is ideal) - IT MAY TAKE A WEEK OR LONGER FOR CHLORINE TO COME DOWN TO SAFE LEVEL (< 10 ppm). If you don't want to wait, and you are confident that your hot tub is contaminate-free, you can skip this step and add a regular chlorine dose via the Maintain tab.</li>
        <li>Once chlorine comes down to a safe level, switch to Maintain tab and begin using hot tub.</li>
      </ol>
