      <h2>What if my TA and pH are both high?</h2>
      <p>Add Sodium Bisulfate "pH Down" to lower TA by 10 ppm per day. If this causes your pH to dip too low, raise your pH by running the jets more (aerating the water). Aerating the water will not affect TA.</p>
      <h2>What if my TA and pH are both low?</h2>
      <p>Add Sodium Bicarbonate to increase TA by 10 ppm per day. If this causes your pH to spike too high, wait two hours and then add the necessary pH Down to get pH back to 7.6.</p>
      <h2>What if my TA is low but my pH is high?</h2>
      <p>Add Sodium Bicarbonate to increase TA by 10 ppm per day. Wait two hours and then add the necessary pH Down to get pH down to 7.6.</p>
      <h2>What if my TA is high but my pH is low?</h2>
      <p>Add Sodium Bisulfate "pH Down" to lower TA by 10 ppm per day. If your pH is significantly low, wait 2 hours then increase it by adding Sodium Carbonate to get pH up to 7.6. If pH is only slightly low, increase it by running the jets more (aerating the water). Aerating the water will not affect TA.</p>
      <h2>What is the relationship between TA and pH?</h2>
      <p>TA is the buffer for pH. If TA is low, pH will be unstable and can easily swing up or down. If TA is high, pH will be stable but may be too high. With the Dichlor/Bleach method, the sweet spot is approximately TA = 50 and pH = 7.6. Once you get both levels set, you can likely go weeks without having to adjust either.</p>
      <h2>Why do I care about Cyanuric Acid (CYA)?</h2>
      <p>If you have no CYA in your water, you will have trouble maintaining your required FC level (the chlorine will be quickly destroyed). If CYA is 30-50 ppm, your chlorine will be properly stabilized. If CYA exceeds 50 ppm, your chlorine will become less effective. Dichlor contains CYA but Sodium Hypochlorite does not.</p>
